# FileOrganizer
Simple python script to sort and organize your files. (Learning Project)

PIL is required to run the script, make sure to install it with the "pip install pillow" command.
I advise to run the v2 version, the v1 is a first attempt and is very clunky.

If you want to run the script with a GUI, just run the v3 file.

Becouse I made this project as a form of learning, I didn't bother to much with the GUI's feedback. If you choose to use the v3 version, make sure to check the console for errors or specific feedback.
